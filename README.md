## Introduction

Haskell is powerful at building fantastic DSL. By using the so-called [free monad](http://comonad.com/reader/2008/monads-for-free/), one can design a DSL in a monadic context. 

For a concrete example, see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foreverbell/parakeet-DSL/master/src/Main.hs) (Yes, one of my favourites, Kouji Wada's "Butter fly").
